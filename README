This is a histogram extractor for Jmeter. Use a sampler of some sort to
get an image into the sample result, then add this extractor to the
sampler. It will create a heaping helping of jmeter variables representing
the red, green and blue pixel count at each image intensity (0-255.)
It will also provide total nonzero bucket counts for red, green and blue.
If the image is monochrome/transparent, the bucket counts will be 1 each,
which might be a handy way to tell if the image has content in it.

It also creates an image_found variable which will be false if the sampler
did not have a recognizable image in it.

This extractor uses JAI to create the histogram, so you need to install
JAI (1.3) into your jmeter/lib directory. I don't muck around with the
hardware acceleration and it probably doesn't buy you anything here, so
feel free to use the non-accelerated version.

This extractor uses java image IO to read the image from the sampler.
If your image format requires an image IO plugin, you should just be able
to drop it into your jmeter lib dir.

Building:

I use maven. The jmeter guys don't like maven and I do. I haven't found a
reliable maven repository for jmeter, so I just point the build to my local
install dirs. Build should work if you have jmeter installed in home, but
YMMV.

"mvn package" ought to do the trick. If it doesn't, take a look at the pom.xml
and make sure your maven is looking in the right place for jmeter and JAI.
